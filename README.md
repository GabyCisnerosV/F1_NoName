# F1_PredictingPodiumAlgorithm

My name is Gabriela, and I follow F1 since I was around 10 years old. I am looking for an algorithm that helps me predict who will win the race several laps before it ends. This is a project in continuous progress as I am testing different algorithms to find the one that is closer to help me make my predictions

It is difficult, I know! :O
There are a lot of factors that influence who wins a race in F1. Some of them can be predicted easily but some of them cannot.

If you have a suggestion or an idea, please feel free to let me know ;)
